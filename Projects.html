            <h8>Feeding Tampa Bay Standard Operating Procedures</h8>
            <h9>Last spring, my student organization Supply Chain Professionals and I worked alongside Feeding Tampa Bay to rewrite their standard operating procedures (SOP) before their warehouse location change. We received guidance from leading consulting firm McKinsey & Comapny, who taught us the principles of writing SOPs and helped to guide our process. This project involved conversing with current Feeding Tampa Bay leaders and employees about their daily processes and anticipated changes to these processes following their move, and then creating work documents for each daily function. </h9>

            <h8>Six Sigma Green Belt</h8>
            <h9>While interning at Honeywell, I obtained my Lean Six Sigma Green Belt certification. This process involved passing a 16-hour course in Lean processes, and then creating supporting documentation to demonstrate my use of Lean principles during my internship projects. This included explaining the implementation of cycle counts and SOPs in our stockrooms, which led to an increase in stockroom accuracy from 81% to 91% and estimated annual labor savings of $50,000. </h9>

            <h8>AWESOME Scholar</h8>
            <h9>This past spring, I was named as an AWESOME (Achieving Womenâ€™s Excellence in Supply Chain Operations, Management, and Education). This award involves engaging webinars to learn from female industry leaders as well as a networking conference next May.</h9>
            <div class="pages-content">
            <h8>WISE Conference</h8>
            <h9>In October of 2023, I was awarded a scholarship to attend the WISE (Women Impacting Supply Chain Excellence) Conference at the University of Arkansas. This was an amazing opportunity to tour corporate facilities and distribution centers belonging to Sam's Club, J.B. Hunt, and Walmart, as well as to hear from panels of inspiring women in supply chain and network with aspirational peers and industry leaders. </h9>
