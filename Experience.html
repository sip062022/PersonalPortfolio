            <h6>From June to August of 2024, I interned at Honeywell Aerospace Technologies as an integrated supply chain inntern. In this role, I worked alongside the materials management team to improve inventory accuracy and standard operating procedures through the use of SAP and Excel.

            <h5>Supply Chain Professionals at USF</h5>
            <h6>For the past two years, I have been involved with Supply Chain Professionals at USF, a student-led professional organization which supports supply chain management networking and professional development, since December of 2022. My journey working with the organization began in December of 2022 when I began working as the Vice President of Membership. In this role, I organized promotional tabling events, pitched the organization to groups ranging from 20 to 400 people, streamlined our modes of communication to be on a single platform, and initiated the creation of our monthly newsletter. In December of 2023, I assumed my current role of President, in which I lead a team of 13 students to carry out the functions of the organization and continuously expand our presence on campus. This involves fostering connections with companies which present to our members, organizing corporate tours, and finding new ways to enhance our members' experiences. </h6>
